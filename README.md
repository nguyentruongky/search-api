# First TypeScript lesson

I'm following an awesome tutorial to learn TypeScript. 

I spent 2 days to learn TypeScript syntax but felt confuse at all. Can't remember syntax and understand well fundamental concepts. Get confuse with Swift and Javascript. So changed the strategy: learning by example. 

Try some but this tutorial is super cool. It's written in clean and professional way. You can follow this tut yourself at [https://itnext.io/production-ready-node-js-rest-apis-setup-using-typescript-postgresql-and-redis-a9525871407](https://itnext.io/production-ready-node-js-rest-apis-setup-using-typescript-postgresql-and-redis-a9525871407).
